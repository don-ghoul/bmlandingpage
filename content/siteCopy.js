          question: "Does Benchmark ERS replace our LMS?",
          answer:
            "No. It works alongside your existing LMS (such as Canvas, Schoology, or Google Classroom) by adding standards intelligence, interactive tables, and calendars that connect curriculum to student outcomes."
        },
        {
          question: "Can we review standards matches before acting on them?",
          answer:
            "Yes. Teams can inspect where standards appear in lesson plans and assessments and confirm whether detected standards are instructionally correct."
        },
        {
          question: "Which standards frameworks are supported?",
          answer:
            "Benchmark ERS stays up to date with evolving state and district standards and can support common frameworks such as NGSS and CCSS, as well as district-managed standards libraries."
        },
        {
          question: "Can leaders compare standards status across classes, schools, and districts?",
          answer:
            "Yes. Role-based, interactive tables and calendars allow district and school representatives to filter by organization, teacher, or course to see addressed, assessed, and missing standards in real time."
        },
        {
          question: "How does mastery analytics work?",
          answer:
            "Mastery views connect student performance to the specific standards being taught and assessed, summarizing outcomes at the district-, school-, and teacher-level."
        },
        {
          question: "How does this support professional development?",
          answer:
            "Real-time visibility into standards coverage and mastery outcomes helps districts tailor intentional, targeted professional development and classroom support while saving time on manual check-ins."
        },
        {
          question: "Can we start small?",
          answer:
            "Yes. Many organizations begin with a subset of schools, grade bands, or departments and expand after validating workflow fit and impact."
